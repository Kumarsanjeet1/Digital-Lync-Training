Control Statements: Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program.

1. while: When we don't the exact no of iterations, we can go for while

    > If condition is true, it executes the statements until the condition false.
    > But if condition is becoming false for every scenario, it doesn't execute any statements present in it.

        Syntax:

            while(condition) {
                // Statements
            }

2. do while: When we don't the exact no of iterations, we can go for do while.

    > If condition is true, it executes the statements until the condition false.
    > But if condition is becoming false for every scenario, it executes the statements present in it for one time.

        Syntax:

            do {    
                // Statements
            } while(condition);
3. for

    Syntax:

        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // Statements...
        }

ES6

for each:

    arrayName.forEach(function(value, index) {
        // Statements...
    });

for in : It is used to iterate through key value pair present in object.

    Syntax:

        for (var key in object) {
            // Statements...
        }

for of:

    for (var value of arrayName) {
        // Statements...
    }

Syntax:

    List of Buses: [] = 10
