Conditional Statements:

Conditional statements are used to decide the flow of execution based on different conditions. If a condition is true, you can perform one action and if the condition is false, you can perform another action.

1. If else
2. Switch

If else:

    Syntax:

        if (condition) {
            // Different action statements
        } else {
            // Different action statements
        }

        if condition is true, source code present in if block will be executed.
        if condition is false, source code present in else block will be executed.

        if (condition) {
            // Different action statements
        } else if (condition) {
            // Different action statements
        } else if (condition) {
            // Different action statements
        } else {
            // Different action statements
        }

Switch:

    > When we have more no of conditions, we need to go for switch rather than if else
    Syntax:

        switch(condition) {
            case value1: {

                break;
            }
            case value2: {
                break;
            }
            case value3: {

                break;
            }
            case value4: {

                break;
            }
            default: {

            }
        }

        break - Used to come out of switch condition.

> Since we are adding break, at a time only one case will be executed.
> If none of the cases are matching, it will execute the source code which is present in default block.
